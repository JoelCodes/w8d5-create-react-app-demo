# W8D5 Lecture Project

This is a lecture project.  I start with a simple server api and build from there.

## Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory and run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` to start the server.

## Client Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` and run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`.
1. To run a production build, use `npm run build`.
